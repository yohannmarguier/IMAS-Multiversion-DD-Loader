# IMAS-Multiversion-DD-Loader

Vocabulary for the boundary between an IMAS HLI and IMAS-Core. Fixes the terms so later prose, comments and error messages don't drift into synonyms for the same handful of concepts.

## Language

**shim**:
This project's library.
_Avoid_: loader, middleware, wrapper, translator — pick this term and use it everywhere.

**loader**:
The operating system's dynamic loader — the mechanism behind `dlopen`/`dlsym` on Linux, or the equivalent on any other platform. Never this project, despite the repository name.
_Avoid_: using "loader" for the shim itself; if a sentence could mean either, name the OS loader explicitly.

**seam**:
An ABI entry point carrying a DD path or IDS name, hence needing translation rather than plain forwarding.
_Avoid_: conversion point, hook, interception point.
